# Notification Clear Fix - Summary

## Problem
When users cleared notifications (either individually or all at once), the notifications would reappear after a page refresh. This was happening because the database DELETE operations were being blocked by Row Level Security (RLS).

## Root Cause
The `notifications` table was missing a DELETE policy in its RLS configuration. The schema had policies for:
- ✅ SELECT (view notifications)
- ✅ INSERT (create notifications)  
- ✅ UPDATE (mark as read)
- ❌ DELETE (missing - this was the problem!)

Without the DELETE policy, Supabase's RLS was blocking all DELETE operations, causing the notifications to remain in the database even after the user tried to clear them.

## Solution
Added the missing DELETE policy to allow users to delete their own notifications.

## Files Modified
1. **auto-generation-schema.sql** - Added DELETE policy to the schema
2. **apply-migrations.sql** - Added conditional DELETE policy creation
3. **add-notification-delete-policy.sql** - Quick fix script (created new file)

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Quick Fix SQL Script (Recommended)
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `add-notification-delete-policy.sql`
4. Click "Run"
5. You should see a table showing the policy was created successfully

### Option 2: Run the Full Migration
If you want to apply all pending migrations, run `apply-migrations.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

## Verification
After applying the fix:
1. Clear one or more notifications
2. Refresh the page
3. The notifications should stay deleted ✅

## What This Policy Does
The policy ensures that users can only delete their own notifications:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own notifications"
  ON notifications FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This maintains security while allowing the functionality to work properly.

## Additional Notes
- The policy uses `auth.uid()` which gets the currently authenticated user's ID
- Only notifications where `user_id` matches the authenticated user can be deleted
- This prevents users from deleting other users' notifications
